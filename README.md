# STEVE-O: Connect, Share, Discover

STEVE-O is an open source semantic web tool for research discovery -- finding people and the research they do.

STEVE-O supports editing, searching, browsing and visualizing research activity in order to discover people, programs,
facilities, funding, scholarly works and events. STEVE-O's search returns results faceted by type for rapid retrieval of
desired information across disciplines.
